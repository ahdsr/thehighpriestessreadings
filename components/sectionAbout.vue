            I am a Tarot Reader and Psychic. I offer Psychic Tarot Readings to
            help you achieve the clarity and guidance you seek. My purpose is to
            relay the messages that spirit has for you. Readings mainly include
            messages derived from Tarot, and also include information in the
            form of images, words, feelings and emotions derived from Psychic
            connection methods.
