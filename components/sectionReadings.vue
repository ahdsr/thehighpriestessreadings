          Think of a reading as having a conversation with spirit. What are you
          curious about?
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We can read for a range of topics including romance, career, family,
          friendship, spirituality, money, living arrangement, challenges,
          goals, etc. Let the cards be your guide.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When booking, provide plenty of detail about your question and the
          situation surrounding it.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Think of cards as advisors, here to illuminate your path and best
          course of action. Ask your question in an empowering way.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You hold the power to create your future and to make your own choices,
          the cards and spirit are simply here to help you navigate.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Think about what you want: action, success, clarity, illumination,
          healing, connection, etc. We will ask the cards how you can get there,
          and what you need to know in this moment.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You are encouraged to revisit your reading every few months. Meaning
          will often continue to uncover itself over time.
