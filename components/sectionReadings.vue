          Readings are written by me and emailed to you within 3 days of your
          booking date. Your readings will include information derived from both
          Tarot cards, and from Channeling.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When booking, provide plenty of detail about your question and the
          situation surrounding it. Think of a reading as having a conversation
          with spirit. What are you curious about?
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You hold the power to create your future. The cards are here to
          illuminate your path and best course of action. Ask your question in
          an empowering way. Topics can include romance, career, family,
          friendship, spirituality, money, living arrangement, challenges,
          goals, aspirations, etc. Let the cards be your guide.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You are encouraged to revisit your reading every few months. Meaning
          will often continue to uncover itself over time.
